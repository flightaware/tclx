EXTENDED TCL SOURCE DIRECTORY HIERARCHY
=======================================

Building the Extended Tcl requires access to built Tcl and Tk source
directories.  Their location relative to the tclX7.1a directory must be
configured by editing tclX7.1a/Config.mk.  The default is to place tclX7.1a
in a directory parallel to the Tcl and Tk distributions:

                   tcl7.1      tk3.4      tclX7.1a


The following directories are included under the tclX7.1a directory:

    o man - Unformatted manual pages for TclX.

    o src - The main source for TclX.

    o osSupport - Library routines required by TclX that may not be available
      on all Unix versions.

    o tclsrc - Tcl source that is built into the standard Tcl package library.
      The makefile also handles generation of help files.

    o tests - Tests for TclX.

    o tclhelp - The Tcl and TclX help files.  These can be rebuilt from the
      manual pages if necessary.

    o tksrc - A makefile that builds a version of the Tk wish shell containing
      Extended Tcl.

    o tktclsrc - Tcl source that is built into the standard Tk package library.
      The makefile also handles generation of help files.

    o tktests - Files used to test wishx.

    o tkhelp - The Tk help files.  These can be rebuilt from the manual pages
      if necessary.

    o experimental - A directory of experimental and contributed Tcl source.
      The code is not normally built as part of TclX.

    o tools - Tools used for building and installing TclX.

    o tclmaster - Tcl master directory.  All files required to run TclX are
      built or copied into this directory.  The entire contents of this
      directory are installed.  This directory is created by the build.

    o tkmaster - Tk master directory.  All files required to run Tk
      are built or copied into this directory.  The entire contents of
      this directory are installed.  This directory is created by the build.


THE EXTENDED TCL INSTALLATION MODELS
====================================

Two installation models are supported by Extended Tcl.  You should decide which
model you are going to use before building TclX.  We encourage use of the 
"master directory" model, as it supports multiple versions of Extended Tcl and
Tk being installed on the system at the same time and allows for easy copying
to other systems.

Standard Installation Model
---------------------------

The standard model follows the GNU standards.  Two variables are defined
by configure, "prefix" and "exec_prefix".  The variable "prefix" is the
path that will contain the directories containing hardware and system
independent files:

   o ${prefix}/tclX/7.1a - TclX runtime files.
   o ${prefix}/tkX/3.4a - TkX runtime files.
   o ${prefix}/include - Include files for TclX.
   o ${prefix}/man - Manual pages for TclX.

The variable "exec_prefix" is the path that will contain the directories
containing hardware and system dependent files:

   o ${exec_prefix}/bin - tcl, wishx and tclhelp programs.
   o ${exec_prefix}/lib - libtclx.a and libtkx.a

Both "exec_prefix" and "prefix" default to "/usr/local".  All of these
directories can be changed independently by editing "Config.mk".  To set
the prefix directories:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/site  --exec_prefix==/usr/site.cray

With the standard model, only Extended Tcl files are installed.  Its is
assumed that the Tcl & Tk standard libraries, include files and manual
pages have been installed.

Master Directory Installation Model
-----------------------------------

The master directory model installs *all* files required by TclX (including
files from the Tcl and Tk distributions) in master directories.  

   o ${prefix}/tclX/7.1a - TclX runtime files.
   o ${prefix}/tclX/7.1a/include - Include files.
   o ${prefix}/tclX/7.1a/man - Manual pages.
   o ${prefix}/tclX/7.1a/bin - tcl program.
   o ${prefix}/tclX/7.1a/lib - libtclx.a and libtcl.a

   o ${prefix}/tkX/3.4a - TkX runtime files.
   o ${prefix}/tkX/3.4a/include - Include files.
   o ${prefix}/tkX/3.4a/man - Manual pages.
   o ${prefix}/tkX/3.4a/bin - wishx and tclhelp programs.
   o ${prefix}/tkX/3.4a/lib - libtkx.a and libtk.a

Symbolic links are then built for executables from the standard locations
to the files in the master directory.

   /usr/local/bin/tcl   -> /usr/local/tclX/7.1a/bin/tcl
   /usr/local/bin/wishx -> /usr/local/tkX/3.4a/bin/wishx


If the --arch=ARCH option was specified to configure (see below), the bin and
lib files are stored in architecture-dependent directories with the specified
architecture as a suffix to the directory name:

   o ${prefix}/tclX/7.1a/bin.arch
   o ${prefix}/tclX/7.1a/lib.arch
   o ${prefix}/tkX/3.4a/bin.arch
   o ${prefix}/tkX/3.4a/lib.arch

You may defined "arch" to be any string you like; it might include OS type or
version as well as processor architecture.

Symbolic links are still build from the standard locations of the machines
of specified architecture to the master directory:

   /usr/local/bin/tcl   -> /usr/local/tclX/7.1a/bin.sparc/tcl
   /usr/local/bin/wishx -> /usr/local/tkX/3.4a/bin.sparc/wishx
        
HOW TO BUILD EXTENDED TCL
=========================

    o Configure and compile Tcl 7.1 following the instructions that come with
      Tcl.  You do not need to install it.

    o If you are going to be using Tk and want to build an Extended Tcl wish
      shell (wishx), configure and compile Tk 3.4.  You do not need to install
      it.

    o Enter ./configure to run the configure script.  The following options are
      recognized by the TclX configure script:
 
        o --srcdir=DIR
          If you are using a make that supports VPATH (e.g. GNU make) you can
          use this to compile in a separate directory from the source.
          Note: The source directory must be clean, it can't contain a built
          copy of TclX.

        o --arch=ARCH
          If your are using the master directory installation model, this
          specifies the a suffix to use for the architecture-dependent
          directories under the master directory.  Use the --execprefix
          option for installing architecture-dependent under the standard
          installation model.

        o --prefix=PREFIX
          Directory under which the "include" and "man" directories are
          found for installation. 

        o --execprefix=EXECPREFIX
          Directory under which the "bin" and "lib" directories are
          found for installation.  
 
    o Edit Config.mk in the build directory following the instructions in the
      file.  If the --srcdir option to configure is used, it is copied from
      the source directory to the build directory.  This file is used to
      specify values that can't be figured out by the configure script.  This
      includes the location of the Tcl and Tk distributions.  It's also used
      to specify the sections that the Tcl manual pages are to be installed
      in.

    o Note that the site specific installation options should be set in
      Config.mk before compiling.  It is especially important to set the value
      for TCL_MASTERDIR and TK_MASTERDIR in Config.mk before compiling TclX.
      See the section on "Installing Extended Tcl" for more details.

    o Config.mk can be used to override several values that configure might
      have gotten wrong or that you desire to be change (like gcc vs cc).

    o Now do a "make".  If all goes well, this will build an extended
      "libtclx.a" and the "tcl" executable in the tclmaster directory.  If Tk
      is requested, an extended "libtkx.a" and "wishx" executable will be
      built in the tkmaster directory.

    o Until the Extended Tcl runtime files are installed, "tcl" and "wishx"
      can't be run directly.  To run them before installation, use "runtcl" or
      "runwishx".

    o Extended Tcl comes with help pages that are built from the Tcl 7.1 and
      Tk 3.4 manual pages as well as the TclX manual page.  If you are building
      TclX with a later version of Tcl or Tk, you might want to rebuild these
      manual pages.  If new manual pages have been added, you can add them
      by editing the files "tools/tclmanpages" and "tools/tkmanpages".
      You must have nroff and the man macro package installed on your system
      to build the manual pages.  Enter "make buildtclhelp" to build the
      Tcl and TclX help pages and "make buildtkhelp" to build the Tk manual
      pages or "make buildhelp" to build both.  If the help files are rebuilt,
      another make should be done to copy them into the master directories.

    o Note that if you modify any files in the Tcl or Tk library directories
      you need to do a "make clean" and a "make" to rebuild Extended Tcl,
      as these changes are not detected by the TclX make files.

   We have a limited number of systems available to test Extended Tcl on,
we need your help in supporting TclX on a wide range of platforms.  The nature
of the functionality TclX supports mean a great deal of system dependent code.
Thanks to all of those who have submitted configuration files and changes to
TclX.

TESTING EXTENDED TCL
====================

   There are three sets of tests: the tests for Berkeley Tcl, the tests for
Tk and the tests for Extended Tcl, which test both the new commands added by
Extended Tcl and the procedures defined in the Extended Tcl procedure
library.

    o Run both the Berkeley and TclX tests by typing "make test" in the
      tclX7.1a directory.  The some of the UCB tests require a tcl shell with
      added commands (tcltest in the tcl7.1 distribution).  Because the
      Extended TCL shell (tcl) does not have these commands, the you will
      receive warnings about not having the following commands:

        testasync
        testcmdinfo
        testdcall
        testdstring
        testlink

      Your will also receive warning about not having the following math
      functions:

        T1
        T2

    o To run the Tk tests with wishx, type "make tktest".  The tests require
      a tcl shell with added commands (tcltest in the tcl7.1 distribution).
      Because the Extended TCL shell (tcl) does not have these commands, the
      following tests will not run:

        raise.test

    o The Extended Tcl tests may be run by themselves with "make extdtests".

    o If a test fails, please dig into the test and the C source for the
      function being tested, fix the bug and mail us the change.  If you're
      not inclined to do this, please report the problem, including the output
      of the test, to tcl-project@neosoft.com.  Sometimes tests fail due to
      problems in the system environment or bugs in that test rather than
      problems with TclX.  Even if a few of the tests fail, you probably still
      have a working TclX.  See the "Porting Notes" section of this document
      for problems we have encountered.

    o If you're having trouble with the Berkeley tests, and you suspect that
      the extensions might be involved, you can build a special minimal
      version of Berkeley Tcl by cd'ing to the tcl7.1 directory and doing
      a "make test".  Similarly, you can do "make test" in the tk3.4 directory.

INSTALLING EXTENDED TCL
=======================

Standard Installation Model
---------------------------

To install Extended Tcl (and Tk if built) using the standard installation
model, enter:

   su use-to-own-files
   make install

to only install the executable and library files (useful for installing on
a multi-architecture server that has the rest of TclX already installed):

   su use-to-own-files
   make install-exec

Master Directory Installation Model
-----------------------------------
To install Extended Tcl (and Tk if built) using the master directory
installation model, enter:

   su use-to-own-files
   make install-master

to only install the executable and library files (useful for installing on
a multi-architecture server that has the rest of TclX already installed):

   su use-to-own-files
   make install-master-exec

PORTING NOTES
=============


General:
   o Flock tests hanging:  Problems have been encountered on some Sun
     systems with the flock tests.  This might occur on other systems as
     well.  These are probably due to an incorrectly configured NFS lockd.
     The tests have been modified to try and report problems rather than
     hang.  It might hang anyway, in this case, rename tests/flock.test to
     tests/flock.bad to prevent them from being run.  If anyone can gives
     any clues into what is going on, we would love to detect this.

DEC Ultrix:
   o Several tests fail when Tcl is run on an NFS mounted file system.

SUN:
   o Seen not on flock tests hanging under the "general" section.

SCO:
   o SCO Unix systems have a "ranlib" command that is used for Xenix cross-
     development.  Pre-ODT 3.0 development systems, the command returns
     an error if used on COFF files.  Many developers rename the command
     to "xranlib" if they are not doing cross development.  Later versions
     of the command return a warning if used on COFF binaries.

SGI:
   o The strftime function does not work correctly on SGI (tested on
     IRIX 4.0.5).  This is a known bug and will be fixed in the next IRIX
     release.  The fmtclock command specifying the GMT argument (perhaps
     only during daylight) returns a formated time that is one hour off.  This
     causes the following clock tests to fail:

        clock-3.2
        clock-4.0
        clock-4.1
     
     If this is a problem to your application, add the following macro to your
     Config.mk:
 
         LIBOBJS=strftime.o

     This will cause a functioning (but not internationalized) strftime
     to be built and added to libtclx.a.
