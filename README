TclX7.1a BETA 5 RELEASE NOTES
============================

   This is the TclX7.1a Beta-5 release.  This release is tested and compatible
with tcl7.1 and tk3.4.  Please forward questions/bugs/suggestions to
tcl-project@NeoSoft.com.

EXTENDED TCL
============

    Extended Tcl (TclX), is a set of extensions to Tcl 7.1, the Tool Command
Language invented by Dr. John Ousterhout of the University of California at
Berkeley.  Tcl is a powerful, yet simple embeddable programming language.
Extended Tcl is oriented towards Unix system programming tasks, with many
additional interfaces to the Unix operating system, It is upwardly compatible
with Tcl 7.1.  You take the Extended Tcl package, add it to Tcl 7.1, and from
that you get Extended Tcl.  (Berkeley Tcl is not included in this
distribution, obtain it from ftp.cs.berkeley.edu).

   Support is also included for building a Tk 3.4 wish shell (wishx) with the
Extended Tcl command set.

    Extended Tcl was designed and implemented by Karl Lehenbauer
(karl@NeoSoft.com) and Mark Diekhans (markd@Grizzly.com), with help in the
early stages from Peter da Silva (peter@NeoSoft.com).

   As with Berkeley Tcl, all of Extended Tcl is freely redistributable,
including for commercial use and resale.

   Please read the file INSTALL carefully before building and installing
Extended Tcl.


FEATURES ADDED BY EXTENDED TCL
==============================

   Here is a summary of the features added by Extended Tcl.  For more details
on the commands and functionality provided by Extended Tcl, see the manual
page man/TclX.man.

    o A shell, which provides an environment for developing and executing
      Tcl programs.

    o Advanced Tcl code library facility that is compatible with standard
      Tcl auto-loading.

    o General purpose commands which define new programming constructs,
      debugging and profiling facilities.

    o Unix access commands provide access to many Unix system calls, including
      process management.

    o File I/O commands provide added facilities for accessing and
      manipulating open files.

    o File scanning facility that provides awk-like functionality.

    o Extended list manipulation commands.

    o Keyed lists, a type of list that provides functionality similar to C
      structures.

    o Extended string and character manipulation commands.

    o Time and date manipulation and conversion commands.

    o A simple command for accessing TCP/IP based servers.

    o X/PG based internationalization commands.

ON-LINE HELP
============

    There is a help system included with Extended Tcl.  It contains some
documentation on every command in Berkeley Tcl, Extended Tcl and Tk.  You can
invoke it interactively from within Extended Tcl by typing "help".

    Once you bring Tcl up and have gotten it to pass all the tests, try typing
"help help" to learn how to use help.

    There is also a Tk based help program "tclhelp".

MANUAL PAGES
============

    Man pages in nroff/troff format are provided for all of Tcl and the
extensions in the directory tclX7.1a*/man.  Start with the TclX.man manual.

EXTENDED TCL VERSION NAMING
===========================

    Extended Tcl takes its version number from the corresponding version of
Berkeley (Ousterhout) Tcl upon which it is based, with the addition of a
trailing letter in case there are multiple releases of Extended Tcl within a
single release of Berkeley Tcl.  This release is TclX 7.1a.

INTERFACING TCL AND C++
=======================

C++ programmers can include the file "tcl++.h" to define C++ classes that can
be used to access a Tcl interpreter.  This is based on Tcl C++ classes
originally developed by Parag Patel.  The files

        src/tclXmain.c
and
        tksrc/tkXmain.c

will compile under both C and C++.  If your have a C++ compiler that requires
the main to be compiled with C++ (g++ does not have this restriction), use
these files renamed to have the correct suffix for C++ (usually .C).


PACKAGE LIBRARIES
=================

    Package Libraries are a Tcl source code management tool included in
this release.  Package libraries allow you to group Tcl procedures into
logical bundles and create single files, libraries, that contain multiple
packages.  The package code provides a low-overhead means of automatically
demand-loading a package on the first attempt to execute one of the procedures
defined within it.  As such, package libraries provide a mechanism to
accommodate the creation of Tcl applications and libraries of a substantial
size.  The TclX library mechanism is a super-set of the mechanism provided
with standard Tcl.

LINKING TCL APPLICATIONS
========================

   To build a TclX based application containing C code, start with either:

        tclmaster/src/tclXAppInit.c for just TclX
or
        tkmaster/src/tkXAppInit.c for TclX & Tk

and add your application initialization.  There are comments in the code to
guide you. The "main" object file is already in the libraries, all you have
to do is link a customized tclXAppInit.o or tkXAppInit.o file with your
application and the Tcl libraries.  For example:

  cc tclXAppInit.o mystuff.a libtclx.a libtcl.a ${SYSLIBS} -o myapp

  cc tkXAppInit.o mystuff.a libtkx.a libtk.a libtclx.a libtcl.a ${SYSLIBS} \
     -o myapp

Each of those directories has a file SYSLIBS that contains the system
libraries that the TclX configure script thinks you should use for linking
programs.  These are in a form that can be included from a make file.  These
file are in a format that can be included from a make file.

SUPPORT FOR EXTENDED TCL
========================

    We are committed to providing continuing support for Extended Tcl.  Please
send questions, bug reports, and bug fixes to:

         tcl-project@NeoSoft.com

COMPATIBILITY WITH TclX 6.5c
============================

   We have attempted to main backwards-compatibility with older versions
of TclX.  A few changes were made to enhance usability or fix problems that
have introduced a few incompatibilities, these are listed below.  Remember
that multiple versions of Tcl may be installed on a system using the Tcl
default file, so you don't have to convert everything at once.  See the
CHANGES file for full details.  These are the major incompatible changes:

   o TclX auto loading has been made compatible with standard Tcl.  The
     path is now found in the "auto_path" variable instead of "TCLPATH".
     The "demand_load" function has been renamed "auto_load" and "load" has
     been renamed "auto_load_file".  The "autoload" procedure no longer exists.
   o The variable programName was changed to argv0 for compatibility with
     Tcl.
   o Removed outdated execvp proc, use execl directly.
   o Removed "flush" option on "cmdtrace".  Output lines are now flushed after
     each command is traced.
   o Changed "signal trap" to edit the command, replacing %S with the signal
     name rather than storing in the global variable "signalReceived".  This
     fixes bugs with signals received in a signal handler.


CAVEATS
=======

    Do not create any set-user-id versions of Tcl yet.  There are holes in
the startup sequence that need to be plugged first and guidelines need to
be developed.

TCL USENET NEWSGROUP
====================

    A Usenet newsgroup, comp.lang.tcl, is dedicated to discussing Tcl, Tk and
the applications that embed it.
